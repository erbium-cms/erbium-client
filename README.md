# erbium cms - web client

The web client for the [erbium CMS](https://github.com/erbium-cms/erbium-cms).

The web application has been initially created by using
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). We also use
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for managing our packages.

As it is usual for a app created with create-react-app, you can use the
following commands:

* `yarn start`
  Starts the development server.
* `yarn build`
  Bundles the app into static files for production.
* `yarn test`
  Starts the test runner.
* `yarn eject`
  Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and
  scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can't go back!
